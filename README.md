## A SIMPLE TRANSISTOR TESTER

Do you have a number of transistors which have their numbers rubbed off or odd transistors of an un-identified type? This circuit will test them and find out if they are PNP or NPN. It is short-circuit proof so putting a transistor round the wrong way will , not damage it. The diagram is set for NPN types. The terminals marked C B and E can be alligator clips on short lengths of hook-up wire. The transformer T1 is a speaker transformer salvaged from a transistor radio. It can have any impedance such as 400:8 ohm and must be inserted so that the primary winding gives a feed-back to the secondary winding. When this occurs, you will hear a whistle in the speaker. Now you are ready to try all your odd types. Those that do not oscillate should be put aside and re-tested when the battery with its current limiter is reversed at terminals A and B.
